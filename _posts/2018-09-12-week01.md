# Assignment 1: Contributing to OpenStreetMap
I was expecting to not find a lot of locations that had not been updated and/or never added,
but I was very wrong. There is a mini outlet mall near my home and basically nothing had been 
added or updated. I added the name, address, and hours of operation to a few different stores
such as Starbucks, AT&T, etc. While I was working on the assignment, I was in Williamsburg and
decided to look around and I saw that Martha's Bakery's location was in the wrong place and 
updated it. In the link below you will be able to see these changes.

# Asssignment 2: Readings on History and Context

**Richard Stallman**

1. Launched the development of the free operating system GNU, in order to avoid the 
   nonfree operating systems that deny freedom to their users in 1984
2. Distinguishing between Free Software and Open Source, noting that Open Source should be
   thought of as 'free speech' instead of 'free beer' which I interpret as one is free to
   contribute to a project but not take the project itself.
3. Developed the GNU General Public License (or the GNU GPL) which was designed to 
   specifically protect the freedom of any user of a program in the 1980s.

**Eric Raymond**

1. Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
> Funny enough, this is the concept behind my decision to study computer science without me 
  really knowing it. See I have always played video games and in the midst of beating some 
  boss level or simply playing I would say “Why not do this.. What if instead of..” followed 
  by some game altering scenario to fix something that bothered me. I decided that I wanted 
  to one day know how it all works and hopefully contribute in some way. 
  
2. Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be 
   characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
> This is significant because it holds true in any occasion. I can’t remember the amount of 
  times that I can’t find a bug in a program and when I show it to a friend they find it with 
  ease. That added perspective helps you see what you would eventually find quicker while 
  removing the bias you have towards your own code. That is a very minor example where it’s 
  just one other person’s perspective, imagine how efficient it becomes when you have 100+ 
  pairs of eyeballs fixated on one thing.
